# My Albums

## Live Project

The app can be seen in action **[here](https://mrmauricio.github.io/my-albums/)**.

It may occur a certificate error as the AudioDB API seems unstable, but clicking on cancel everything runs as expected.

## Project Overview

"My Albums" is an app that allows you to search, select and categorize albums you have listened, deciding where it should belong between Masterpiece category (5 stars) and Terrible category (1 star).

## Instructions

### Home Page

On the Home page are placed 5 categories:
- Masterpiece (5 Stars)
- Amazing (4 stars)
- Decent (3 stars)
- Bad (2 stars)
- Terrible (1 star)

The albums that are already placed on each categories are my personal choices, feel free to delete them and add yours. To do that, go to the Search page by clicking on the pulsing Add Button on the top right corner of the screen.

### Search Page

On the search page you can choose an album of your preference and, by clicking on the Add Button on the card's bottom right, you can rate it, deciding in which category it should belong.
You can search by typing on the input or by selecting one of the musical genres. Then, the results will be shown below.
